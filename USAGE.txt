Prerequisites:
* Python 3
* Windows (because I couldn't get Daniel UK working on non-Windows)
* follow the steps in README.md to install the required programs (Balabolka, ImageMagick, FFmpeg)
* a text editor to change some parameters at the top of the Python scripts
* a video editor to put everything together



Usage steps:
0. install the necessary programs
1. Obtain the comment you wish to be read aloud. Paste it into a text file.
2. (Non-developer step) Open the command line and `cd` to where you placed this project. For example, `cd C:/Users/<name>/Desktop/automated-reddit-video-tool`.
3. Split the comment by sentences: `py -3 comment_splitter.py [comment input file] [line-by-line output name]` (non-developers: run this through the command line)
4. (Optional) Manually edit the output file to adjust anything you want. For example, extra pauses when reading a comma-separated list or splitting after emojis.
5. (Optional) Generate a test image of the full comment, so you can change the font size and image size and stuff: `py -3 comment_test_image.py [line-by-line input file] [png file output name]` (change the constants at the top of `comment_test_image.py` to see changes)
6. Take that output and have it read aloud: `py -3 comment_to_speech.py [line-by-line input file] [mp4 file names]` (have a "$" in the MP4 name, because that's where the numbers will go)
7. Note: To edit the parameters of the final output, you will need to edit the constants at the top of `comment_to_speech.py`.
8. Throw the MP4 files into your favorite video editor and do what you want!
9. (Optional) There's an AutoHotkey script included with this project (kdenlive_size_adjustment.ahk) to speed up editing in Kdenlive, since Kdenlive scales the video.



Word censoring:
Make a file in the form
```
bad1|censored1
bad2|censored2
bad3|censored3
```
Then `py -3 comment_splitter.py [input comment file] [split comment file] -c [censored words file]`



Speech different from image text:
`py -3 comment_to_speech.py [line-by-line speech text input file] [mp4 file names] -t [line-by-line image text input file]`
