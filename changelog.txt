1.2.0 "final"
* removed the AHK script since it's no longer needed
* use CRF instead of bitrate for video files
* use the raw wav audio instead encoding it

1.1.0

1.0.2
* option for audio-only output (because that's what I use this for half the time)
* cleaned up the scripts
    * AHK script: realized effects in Kdenlive can be copied by simply dragging it onto another clip, making half this script useless...

1.0.1
* changed default video settings, updated AHK script
* option to replace/generate a single video

1.0.0 "done"
* better command line inputs
* program generates the wav, then png, then mp4 file for each line (instead of *every* wav, then png, then mp4)

* AHK script QoL update: constants at top

0.8.0 "initial release"
* comment splitting
* comment to wav, png, and mp4
